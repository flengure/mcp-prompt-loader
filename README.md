A lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that loads prompts from `.txt` files.

## Features

- 🔹 **Folder Mode**: mount a folder with multiple `.txt` files and they are served as prompts
- 🔹 **Tooling**: list prompts and fetch content via JSON-RPC
- 🔹 **Clients Supported**: Claude Desktop, Zed, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, docker-mcp-gateway
- 🔹 **No Restarts**: drop in new files and they show up automatically on `list_prompts`

---

## Installation / Usage

Mount a folder containing your `.txt` prompt files:

```bash
docker run --rm -i \
  -v ~/Documents/prompts:/prompts:ro \
  flengure/mcp-prompt-loader:latest
```

Your client config (Claude Desktop, Zed, etc.) will call this container and use prompts by name.
