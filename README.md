A lightweight Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that loads system prompts from plain text files.
Works with Claude Desktop, Zed, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf, and via docker-mcp-gateway.

---

## Features

- **Folder mode** â€” mount a directory of `.txt` files, instantly exposed as prompts.
- **No rebuilds** â€” add or edit `.txt` files and they show up immediately.
- **Cross-client** â€” tested with Claude Desktop, Zed, Gemini CLI, Cursor, Windsurf.
- **Dockerized** â€” runs as a simple container, no Node/npm setup needed.
- **Multi-arch** â€” published for both `amd64` and `arm64`.

---

## Usage

### 1. Prepare a prompts folder

```bash
mkdir ~/Documents/prompts
echo "You are a helpful writing assistant." > ~/Documents/prompts/writer.txt
echo "You are a research copilot." > ~/Documents/prompts/researcher.txt
```

### 2. Run with Docker

```bash
docker run --rm -i   -v ~/Documents/prompts:/prompts:ro   flengure/mcp-prompt-loader:latest
```

---

## Tools

### `prompts/list`
Lists all `.txt` files in `/prompts` and exposes them by name (filename without `.txt`).

Example result:
- writer
- researcher
- teacher

### `prompts/get`
Returns the full text of a specific prompt by name (without `.txt`).

Input:
- `name` (string) â€” e.g. `writer`, not `writer.txt`

Behavior:
- Reads the file fresh on every call (no restart needed).

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** First run `prompts/list` in your MCP client to see whatâ€™s available.
> Then call `prompts/get` with the name (without `.txt`) to load it.

## Troubleshooting

- **I donâ€™t see my new prompt file.**
  `prompts/list` rescans the folder each time, and `prompts/get` re-reads on demand.
  Make sure the file ends in `.txt` and is inside the mounted folder (default `/prompts`).

- **Permission denied or file not found.**
  Check your `-v` mount path is correct and readable. Example:
  `-v /Users/you/Documents/prompts:/prompts:ro`

- **Windows path mapping (Docker Desktop).**
  Use a path like: `-v //c/Users/you/Documents/prompts:/prompts:ro`
  Ensure Docker Desktop has access to that drive.

- **Client shows multiple tools but I canâ€™t select a prompt.**
  Most clients list tools like commands. Run `prompts/list`, then choose a name and call `prompts/get`.

- **Container exits immediately.**
  Your MCP client controls the process lifecycle. It may spawn the container only while connected.
  Thatâ€™s normalâ€”no need to keep it running manually.
