      overview: |
        The n8n AI Workflow Expert provides intelligent automation guidance with deep knowledge of:

        â€¢ **Workflow Design**: Best practices for efficient and maintainable workflows
        â€¢ **Node Configuration**: Detailed guidance for 535+ available n8n nodes
        â€¢ **Integration Patterns**: Common patterns for API integrations and data transformation
        â€¢ **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and workflow reliability
        â€¢ **Performance Optimization**: Scaling workflows and managing execution efficiency

        Choose from specialized expert prompts tailored to different experience levels and use cases.

      quick_start: |
        1. **Select Expert**: Choose a specialization matching your workflow needs
        2. **Set Complexity**: Indicate your target workflow complexity level
        3. **Deploy**: Start the expert and begin asking workflow questions
        4. **Build**: Get step-by-step guidance for creating powerful automations

      use_cases:
        - title: "API Integration Workflows"
          description: "Connect multiple services and transform data between systems"
          example: "How do I sync customer data between Salesforce and Slack?"

      best_practices: |
        **Workflow Design**:
        â€¢ Start with simple workflows and add complexity gradually
        â€¢ Use descriptive node names and add notes for documentation
        â€¢ Implement proper error handling for all external API calls

        **Performance**:
        â€¢ Minimize API calls by batching operations when possible
        â€¢ Use Set node for data transformation instead of multiple nodes
        â€¢ Consider workflow execution limits and timeouts

        **Security**:
        â€¢ Store sensitive data in credentials, never in node parameters
        â€¢ Use environment variables for configuration values
        â€¢ Implement proper authentication for all external connections

      troubleshooting:
        - issue: "Workflow execution fails"
          solution: "Check error outputs, verify credentials, and test individual nodes"
        - issue: "Slow workflow performance"
          solution: "Review API call patterns, reduce unnecessary operations, check node configuration"
        - issue: "Data transformation issues"
          solution: "Use Function nodes for complex transformations, validate data types"

    security:
      permissions:
        - "read-only prompt file access"
        - "no external network connections"
        - "no credential storage"
      data_handling:
        - "No sensitive workflow data processed"
        - "Prompt files mounted read-only"
        - "All automation guidance provided through MCP Gateway"
